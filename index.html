        <h2 style="color: #8A1919" id="cisw"> CISW 306 Description </h2>
        <p>
            This course introduces <em>foundation concepts of coding</em> HTML, CSS, and using a content management system for the production of Web pages. Web page creation will include formatting, layout, construction, and presentation. The current version of markup language will be introduced, as identified by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). This course also introduces methods used to design accessible websites for people with disabilities. Students will design and develop pages accessible to people with disabilities, in accordance with the W3C Accessibility Standards. This includes understanding how to perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the Web. <strong>This course explores software tools to assist visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, and neurological disabilities,</strong> and has students experience using pages on the Web using software or open-source tools to illustrate various tools used to view Web pages for accessibility. Current legal requirements for accessible websites, including the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 508, are emphasized and implemented in project work produced in this course. Students who have successfully completed CISC 306 and CISW 370 are not eligible to take this course.

        <h2 style="color: #8A1919">How to Host a Website</h2>
        <p>
            To host a personal website you need to <strong>store it on a web server.</strong> You can host it on your <em>own server,</em> but this may be more expensive than renting a server from an <em>Interner Service Provider.</em> Things to consider while renting a server are 24-hour support, bandwidth restrictions, daily back up, database access.
            The next thing you need is a <strong>domain name.</strong> This is a unique name for your Website. Domain name should be easy to remember and type. You need to register your domain name. Choosing a hosting solution should include domain name registration.
            Make sure you have <strong>sufficient</strong> disk space and traffic volume.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color: #8A1919"> Web Accessibility</h2>
        <p>
            Web accessibility means that people with some type of disability will be able to use the Web. This may be people who are <strong>visually impaired</strong> or legally blind, they may have <strong> auditory or speech disability</strong> Disability also includes <strong> physical, cognitive and neurological disabilities. </strong> Elderly may also benefit from web accessiblilty. An accessible website is perceivable, operable, understandable and robust.
