            <h3>Introduction</h3>

                This is the part I have always struggled with. I start working out and then will be great for a while and then something happens and I get an excuse to sit back and veg! My husband definitley helps in keeping me motivated. it definitely helps to have a buddy who you answer to. Since the Covid stay in place started, I stopped going to my gym and I had to find ways to keep myself moving and get some cardio and streches. A few friends and I got together and started working out over zoom. This kept me motivated since we had a fixed time we would meet and work out. I have been doing Yoga for a while now, and I love it. This includes Pranayams, breathwork. So I used to lead the yoga class while my husband led the weights and cardio. We did this on alternate days. I thought, well, this is great! Then came my blood work from my yearly check up. My cholestrol numbers and LDL were not looking great. This was inspite of a vegetarian diet and workouts everyday! I realized after the hour of workout, I was just in my chair for the rest of the day for my work. This was a wake up call for me. I added morning and after dinner walks to my schedule. I feel great. Now I actually miss my walks and workouts if we happen to skip them.

            <h3>Yoga</h3>
            <p>

                Here are some of my favorite yoga poses. Vinyasa basically means yoga that flows from one pose or asana into the next. This is the kind I love.
